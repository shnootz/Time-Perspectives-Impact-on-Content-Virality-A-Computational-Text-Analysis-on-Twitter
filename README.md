# Time Perspectives on Impact Content Virality: A Computational Text Analysis on Twitter

"Space and time are the framework within which the mind is constrained to construct its experience of reality." 

â€” Immanuel Kant.


This project employs the Contextualized Construct Representation (CCR) approach, combining the large language model (LLM) 'all-MiniLM-L6-v2' with the 56-item Zimbardo Time Perspective Inventory (ZTPI) to analyze Twitter content. Its goal is to uncover how different temporal perspectives influence virality metrics. CCR measures the cosine similarity between the construct being studied and the input text, yielding an association score termed as CCR loading.
